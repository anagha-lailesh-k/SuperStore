Coding platform used: Google Colab 

The outputs of the codes are also uploaded as Outputs.pdf, which was created using Jupyter Notebook for better markdown features, but some of the outputs are not displayed in the file as Jupyter Notebook is not compatible with a few of the packages or functions used in Google Colab.
